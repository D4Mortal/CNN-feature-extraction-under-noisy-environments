## PyTorch-CNN feature extraction
This is a evaluation of the feature extraction abilities of CNN on images compared to an simple feed-forward NN with Local Phase Quantisation (LOQ).\
Both neural networks are tasked to classify the emotions of actors from the images of random scenes in movies, classifying them to one of seven expression classes: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise and neutral.\
Both networks are trained with the "Static Facial Expressions in the Wild" dataset.\
For more details on the results, please view the report.
